# seed-git
Analyzing the first ever commit of the git source code gives a fairly good idea of the inner workings of the [git SCM](https://git-scm.com). The data structures and their representations have remained mostly unchanged and are still relevant. This repository exists to easily get started with the analysis. You can clone this repo, compile and run the [various executables](https://github.com/vijairaj/seed-git/wiki/Executables) to get a feel of how it all started.

# Building with Makefile
Follow the standard build procedure:

    make

# Building with CMake
Follow the standard build procedure:

    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make

# Debugging
One of the ways to analyze the source code is to step through the execution of the code line by line. [Qt Creator](https://wiki.qt.io/Category:Tools::QtCreator) makes this easy because it can read CMake projects directly, so building and debugging is just one step away. Qt Creator can be installed from the distribution package or [downloaded directly](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/).
